# 🐢 CS50p-2022-Solutions

# [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

# My solutions for all the CS50p problem sets.


**I started this course because I wanted to be prepared beforehand for taking Python classes in my college. I had 0 knowledge about programming before starting this course. After starting, I found this course beginner-friendly and useful. If you also want to learn Python and don't know where to start, I would say this course is perfect. Good luck to anyone who is taking this course ✨**

# Academic Honesty
**I created this repository to help my fellow cs50p coursemates. But I would suggest you try the problem sets yourself first. If you are stuck somewhere, then take a little help and then again try to do it on your own**
